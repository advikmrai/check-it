Research starts with sources! The Annotated Source List assignment required compiling a list of the most relevant research sources to my project and providing a brief annotation or summary for each. The purpose of this assignment was to help me work critically with the existing literature, understand the current state of research in the field, and identify how various sources could contribute to my own work. For this assignment, I compiled my sources, keeping track of them in a Notion database. For each entry, I included notes or summaries highlighting the key concepts, relevance to my research (such as understanding computer analysis on music and emotion or noting gaps in existing research), and how the source informed my project development. This process helped me refine my understanding of informatics theory and music theory relevant to my prototype, helped introduce me to current burning questions and gaps in the literature of the field, and developed my skill of critical reading and analysis of such sources.
