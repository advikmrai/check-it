Throughout my research, I have created and delivered several presentations to communicate my progress, findings, and project details to various audiences. The purpose of these presentations has varied depending on the context:

- **Presentations for the JHU Center for Music and Medicine (CMM) members (June 2024—) :** These presentations served to update the directors and members on my research progress, share key findings, and explore potential collaborations. They sometimes included a brief demonstration of the project. I was asked to prepare presentations to share updates from my work with the group.
- **IR Classroom Presentations (December—Jan 2024):** These presentations were required for my Independent Research course at school, summarizing my research progress to teachers and students in other classes to give them even more knowledge.
- **ISEF-Affiliated Science Fair Slides (March 2025):** This involved creating visuals and descriptions to explain the project undertaken at the State science fair.
- **SLC Presentation (April 2025):** Preparation for this presentation was a milestone, where I focused on conveying the key concepts behind my work effectively at the county level.
