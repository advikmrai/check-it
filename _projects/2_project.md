Throughout my research, I have created and delivered several presentations to communicate my progress, findings, and project details to various audiences. The purpose of these presentations has varied depending on the context:

- **Presentations for the JHU Center for Music and Medicine (CMM) members (June 2024—) :** These presentations served to update the directors and members on my research progress, share key findings, and explore potential collaborations. They sometimes included a brief demonstration of the project. I was asked to prepare presentations to share updates from my work with the group.
- **IR Classroom Presentations (December—Jan 2024):** These presentations were required for my Independent Research course at school, summarizing my research progress to teachers and students in other classes to introduce them to the field and scope of my work, build interest in the subject matter and deliver intervallic progress updates.
- **ISEF Affiliate Science Fair Slides (March 2025):** I competed in the Morgan CEMSE Science fair to share the methods, outcomes, and future potential of my work to a scientific audience. My visuals here included snippets of raw data, data charts showing changes in arousal, valence, and dominant emotions over time, and a working live demonstration of the application's interface and facial expression recognition capability to visitors and judges who saw my booth.

- **SLC Presentation (April 2025):** Preparation for this presentation was a milestone, where I focused on conveying the key concepts behind my work effectively at a large county-level conference with hundreds of attendees.
