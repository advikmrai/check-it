My [Research Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZZFHd_KnwDeZU9dF7y56cGqWuVxu444q_llcYYkdZQ/edit?usp=sharing), titled "Algorithmic Arias: Navigating the Melodic Maze of Music and Mind", outlines the plan for my project. The primary focus of the current proposal is the development of a system for personalized music therapy through Affective Algorithmic Composition (AAC). This involves analyzing real-time emotional data from facial expressions to generate music tailored to an individual's emotional state, with the goal of improving therapeutic outcomes. The plan includes creating a working prototype and gathering preliminary data through human trials.

Notably, this research path built upon prior original data collection and analysis conducted in my first year of IR. This earlier work, also under the title "Algorithmic Arias," involved a survey research design incorporating both descriptive and correlational research. Data was collected from 160 participants aged 12 to 78 in April 2024. The data included demographics (Age, Gender, Ethnicity) and information on music preferences and influencing factors, such as preferred genres, artists, listening frequency, and musical background. The hypothesis explored was that significant variations in music preferences and influencing factors would exist across different age groups. For this survey project, data was collected using Google Forms and analyzed using Google Sheets to create graphs, compute statistical measurements (like standard deviation and skewness), and develop working regression models. The aim was to explore the links between collected factors and the hypothesized variations in music preferences. This earlier survey-based research formed the foundation of a previous version of my paper that has been accepted by the Journal of Student Research.
