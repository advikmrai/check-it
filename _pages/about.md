Advik Rai is a junior at River Hill High School researching algorithmic music composition and its effects on the brain. Advik is working with the Center for Music and Medicine at John Hopkins University to research music intervention therapies, particular towards patients suffering from neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. He is developing a computer program that can gauge exact musical preferences in people and generate music tailored to them in real-time. His research explores the use of on-device cameras to capture physiological responses to music in real-time, coupled with advanced AI algorithms to predict and adapt music accordingly. Envisioning beyond entertainment, Advik sees the potential for this technology to revolutionize music therapy. By personalizing music in real-time based on individual responses, it could alleviate anxiety or pain to a greater degree in medical contexts, offering a non-invasive and potentially transformative tool for patient care. He plans to present his findings in form of a research paper through relevant journals such as the Oxford Journal of Music Therapy, and present and demonstrate his app through live workshops.
