Goals and Objectives
====================

Throughout my two years in the program, the overarching goal I have been working towards has been to explore the intersection of music, technology and healthcare through original research. 

In my first year (10th grade), my primary objective was to conduct an initial investigation into music preferences and their influencing factors across different demographics, and found I could do this quickly and efficiently through a survey research project. By the end of that year, I had collected original data, analyzed initial patterns, and drafted a paper on the findings. I had also created a working facial-expression-recognition web app that anyone could access online, through the use of MorphCast AI. I felt this was a significant step forward in sharing my work with a wider audience, especially as that paper was later accepted by the Journal of Student Research. This year was also the time when Dr. Alex Pantelyat and Dr. Kyurim Kang of the John Hopkins Center for Music and Medicine took an interest in my work through my cold email, and that's where things really started to get interesting. 

While the methodology of that initial work was less complex compared to my current project, the undertaking of it served as a foundation for understanding key concepts, building familiarity with the esoteric terminologies used through exposure, and overallâ€”getting a grasp of what was present in the literature and what there was a dearth of. Entering my second year (11th grade), my goals became more ambitious and technologically focused: to develop and disseminate working prototype of a system for personalized music therapy using facial recognition and algorithmic music generation; to conduct preliminary testing; to prepare a more methodologically rigorous paper for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, especially with the support, guidance and opportunities that my collaboration with the Center for Music and Medicine provided me.

As I approach the end of this second year, I note the substantial progress made in app development, data synchronization, and manuscript refinement, despite me facing numerous technical challenges. The process til now has been challenging and incredibly rewarding, but there is still much to go.
